If you're using nano like I am, and you ever need to highlight many lines for indenting/outdenting:
1. Create ~/.nanorc
2. Write the following in the file: 
set tabsize 4
set tabstospaces
3. source ~/.nanorc
4. Go to the file you want to indent/outdent
5. Go to the first line and set a marker (Alt+A)
6. Go to the last line, and indent/outdent with (Esc+} \ Esc+{)
7. Remove marker with Esc+A
8. Save file and exit
